<Paragraph title="AI Shorts" subtitle="This wasn't going to be easy.">
Youtube shorts are a trend right now. However, a few months ago, me and a friend decided to try and automate completely the process
of creating this type of content, using AI. We weren't aiming for a low-quality, half-taped together generator, that creates an obviously-AI-video.
Our goal was to make something that looked credible, that had a chance of going viral and that users would perceive as "normal Youtube Shorts content", without
raising any suspect it being AI.

To Be Finished lol
