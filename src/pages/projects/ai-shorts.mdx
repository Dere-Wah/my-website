<Paragraph title="Can Youtube Content be AI generated?" subtitle="This wasn't going to be easy.">
A few months ago, a friend messaged me about an idea he recently had: making a Youtube-Video-Shorts-Generator-3000 using AI, that would,
given a few information such as a video title and a body, generate a completely modern-style short video, and automatically upload it to youtube.
His goal was to start a fully automatic youtube channel, have it go viral, and eventually monetize it.

When he went up to me with this idea, I already knew he wasn't the first to think about this. In these last couple of years, with the rising of AI,
I've seen tons and tons of attempts at AI generated content, and had already thought of giving it a go myself. I decided to take this as an opportunity
to actually dip my hands into this type of projects, so we hopped on a call and started brainstorming an approach to the problem.

Our first obstacle was: how do you start, from a link to a Reddit Post, and end up with a complete youtube video ready for upload?
