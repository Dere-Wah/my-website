<Paragraph title="Can Youtube Content be AI generated?" subtitle="This wasn't going to be easy.">
A few months ago, a friend messaged me about an idea he recently had: making a Youtube-Video-Shorts-Generator-3000 using AI, that would,
given a few information such as a video title and a body, generate a completely modern-style short video, and automatically upload it to youtube.
His goal was to start a fully automatic youtube channel, have it go viral, and eventually monetize it.

When he went up to me with this idea, I already knew he wasn't the first to think about this. In these last couple of years, with the rising of AI,
I've seen tons and tons of attempts at AI generated content, and had already thought of giving it a go myself. I decided to take this as an opportunity
to actually dip my hands into this type of projects, so we hopped on a call and started brainstorming an approach to the problem. In the end, we settled
for a generator that would fetch a specific pair of Post & Reply from the popular sub r/AskReddit, and generate a youtube short ready for upload.

Converting from a text document to a well-edited & subtitled video is no easy task. Let's think about this problem, and break it up in single stepts that
a computer would need to do to accomplish this goal. First of all, we need to access reddit. Given a link to some content, using the Reddit API, we were able to
access a set of meta information about the post, such as the author, the title, the description, and even the replies. You can think about our "post" object
as something like the following:

```
test aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaa
```

After our post object was found and retrieved, we created a thumbnail for the post. This part was handled by my friend that worked on the project with me,
and basically created an image off of this POST element. Our goal was to display the thumbnail as the first part of the video, as if it was a screenshot
taken off reddit and edited in the short.

We felt that the number of upvotes & comments wasn't a really necessary detail, so we randomly generated those numbers.
